# Regular Expression Tutorial

Hi my name is Gavin and this is my regular expression tutorial. What is a regular expression? Essentialy it is a filter that is imposed on a given string or dataset to find information. 

## Summary

For these examples we will be using the Javascript programming languages, howerver the concpet of regular expressions is not limited to javascript. In fact, lanagues such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, .NET, and many more languages have their forms of regular expressions. 

**An example of a regular expression**
```
let pattern = /hello/g;
let str = "hello world hello";
let matches = str.match(pattern);
console.log(matches); // prints ["hello", "hello"] to the console.
```
The pattern we are searching for is *hello*.
 The deffinition of the regular expression is */hello/*.
 The **g** is a modifier that says check for the pattern globally.

Every Regualr expression in javascript follows this syntax **/pattern/modifier(s);**

## Regex Components

### Anchors

An Anchor is essentially a way to find information with respect to either the **start-of-the-line** or the **end-of-the-line**. I'm going a list of names and store them as a template literal.
```
let string = `
Marry Jane
John Doe
Jane Doe
John Smith
Jane Smith
John Wayne
Jane Wayne
John Lennon
Jane Lennon
`;
```
Here is a list of names, it could be any length but I don't want to display a list that is 10,000 lines long. I want to know how many People are in the Smith family, and I want to know how many people have the first name John in this list, how would I go about getting that information given the string. 
```
let regex = /Smith$/gm;
```
Voil√†, I have created a regular expression *"filter"* that looks for a line that ends with **Smith** our given last name that I am looking for. 
```
let result = string.match(regex);
console.log(result); // returns [ 'Smith', 'Smith' ]
```
I have now figured out that there are two Smiths in the list. Now I will try and find out how many Johns there are on the list 
```
let RegExp = /^John/gm;
```
Creating my regular expression *"filter"*
```
let result2 = string.match(RegExp);
console.log(result2); // return [ 'John', 'John', 'John', 'John' ]
```
I have now determined that there are 4 Johns inside the given string list.

The key takeaway here being that the ```^``` and ```$``` starting and stoping symbols respectively, you can search large sets of string and filter out words that can begin or end with a given pattern. 


### Quantifiers
Generally speaking, when you are talking about quantifers you are refering to the quantity of preceding charecters with respect to the pattern. A little unintuitive admitingly, but if you were to for example want to measure the *number* of charecters in a string you would use a quantifier. 
```
const  = "REEE REEEEEEEEEEEE REE REEEEE EEEE";
const RegExp = /RE{4,}/g; // Notice how I didn't enclose the *RE* in parenthese because we're only measuring the E
console.log(scream.match(RegExp)); // Returns [ 'REEEEEEEEEEEE', 'REEEEE' ]
```
An interesting point is that given the string and the RegExp, it check for a R and 4 OR MORE E's. The {4,} (I'll call it the 4 or more Quantifier) is an example of how you would go about trying to find duplicate charecters for a given array.
